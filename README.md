# Tales From The Middle Of Nowhere

https://kiyo27.github.io/tales-from-the-middle-of-nowhere/

This blog title is named after the title of Noel Gallager's tour blog - Tales From The Middle Of Nowhere, and I like the phrase "the middle of nowhere". But this blog has nothing to do with him.

I loved Oasis and had never been to their live concert, so I was very shocked to see the news that they break up. We are looking forward to seeing them reunite and perform great gigs someday.
